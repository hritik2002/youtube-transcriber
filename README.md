# YouTube Transcriber
YouTube Transcriber is a Python script that automatically transcribes YouTube videos. This script uses the OpenAI API to generate a transcript for any public YouTube video.

## Advantages
Saves time: You don't have to watch the entire content of the video.
Accessibility: The transcripts can help make videos more accessible to those with hearing disabilities or language barriers.
Easy to use: Just provide a valid YouTube video URL, and the script will do the rest.

## Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Obtain a OpenAI API key and add it in the class init function.
Run the script by providing a valid YouTube video URL as an argument. For example: python youtube_transcriber.py https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ.

## Notes
The script only works with public YouTube videos.
The transcription may not be 100% accurate, but it should give a good approximation of the video's content.
